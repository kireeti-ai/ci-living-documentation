# CI-Integrated Living Documentation System

A CI-driven documentation automation platform that ensures engineering artefacts
— such as architectural diagrams, sequence flows, API references, README files,
and changelogs — remain continuously synchronized with the evolving codebase.

This system integrates directly into CI/CD pipelines to detect code changes,
analyze structural impact using AST and dependency graphs, automatically generate
or update documentation, detect documentation drift, and propose updates via
automated pull requests.

## Key Capabilities
- Detects code changes using Git diffs and AST analysis
- Generates architecture, dependency, and sequence diagrams automatically
- Updates README, API documentation, and ADRs
- Detects documentation drift and validates consistency
- Produces natural-language summaries for documentation updates
- Integrates with CI pipelines (GitHub Actions)
- Creates automated pull requests for documentation updates
- Maintains versioned documentation history

## Intended Use
- Engineering teams
- CI/CD pipelines
- Software architecture documentation
- Developer onboarding automation
