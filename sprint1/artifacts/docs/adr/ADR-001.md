# ADR-001: Automated Documentation Generation

## Status

**Accepted**

## Date

1970-01-01

## Context

This project has implemented automated documentation generation to maintain up-to-date technical documentation based on code analysis.

The team needs consistent, up-to-date documentation that reflects actual code changes without manual effort.

### Current State

- **Repository:** git_clone_1t3e32fi
- **Branch:** main
- **Commit:** edb75298
- **Author:** kireeti-ai
- **Files Changed:** 114
- **Severity:** MAJOR
- **Breaking Changes:** Yes

### Problem

Manual documentation maintenance is time-consuming and often becomes outdated as code evolves. Teams need a way to automatically generate and update documentation based on actual code changes.

## Decision

We have implemented a CI/CD-based automated documentation pipeline (EPIC-2) that:

Adopt an automated documentation pipeline that converts impact reports into structured README, ADR, API reference, and architecture artifacts.

1. **Integrates with Code Analysis (EPIC-1)**: Receives impact reports analyzing code changes
2. **Generates Multiple Documentation Types**:
   - README files with repository overview
   - API reference documentation
   - Architecture diagrams (System, Sequence, ER)
   - Folder tree snapshots
   - Documentation metadata (JSON snapshot)
3. **Runs in CI/CD**: Automatically triggered on code pushes
4. **Auto-commits Results**: Documentation is committed back to the repository

### Technology Choices

- **Python** for documentation generators (readable, maintainable)
- **Mermaid** for diagrams (text-based, version-controllable)
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD (integrated with repository)
- **JSON** for structured data exchange between impact analysis and EPIC-2

### Alternatives Considered

- Manual documentation updates (rejected due to maintenance cost)

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Always Up-to-Date**: Documentation regenerates with every code change
- **Reduced Manual Effort**: No manual documentation maintenance required
- **Consistency**: Standardized documentation format across the project
- **Visibility**: Changes are tracked through version control
- **Automation**: CI/CD handles the entire pipeline

### Negative

- **Generated Content Limitations**: Auto-generated docs may lack context that humans provide
- **Template-Based**: Documentation follows predefined templates
- **Requires Impact Report**: Dependent on impact analysis quality

### Neutral

- **Initial Setup Required**: One-time configuration of CI/CD pipeline
- **Git History Growth**: Auto-commits increase repository commit count

## Implementation Details

### Documentation Outputs

1. **README.generated.md**: Overview with repository metadata
2. **api/api-reference.md**: Detected API endpoints
3. **adr/ADR-001.md**: This architecture decision record
4. **architecture/system.mmd**: System architecture diagram
5. **architecture/sequence.mmd**: Process flow sequence diagram
6. **architecture/er.mmd**: Entity relationship diagram
7. **tree.txt**: Hierarchical file tree of changes
8. **doc_snapshot.json**: Metadata about generated documentation

### Trigger Conditions

- Push to main, develop, or epic-2 branches
- Pull requests (for review, without commit)
- Excludes changes to documentation folder (prevents loops)

## Notes

This ADR was automatically generated as part of the EPIC-2 documentation pipeline based on the impact report from commit `edb75298`.
